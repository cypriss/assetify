Assetify
=============

TODO:
 - Generate default JSON files with '{}'
 - handled nested/namespaced controllers
 - Handle cases where we don't even need an include


 - Change the asset compressor to just be some static methods instead of instantiatable.  Both std and multi.  Fix rake/info
 - Specs for info
 - integrate W3C validation of CSS files.  JS files too?
 - JS lint?
 - Plugins!
 - Comments
 - Docs

NOTE: this plugin is not meant to handle all classes of websites.  It may not even handle most of them.  It handles websites that I build, though.
